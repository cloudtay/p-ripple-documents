Ripple is a high-performance native PHP coroutine framework designed to handle high-concurrency, complex network
communications and data operations.

This project is implemented based on PHP8.1's own fiber features + Revolt tool library, providing simpler and
easier-to-use APIs and tools, allowing developers to easily build high-performance PHP applications.

### Project Features

- High performance: By using native PHP coroutines, the application's concurrent processing capabilities are greatly
  improved.
- Compatibility: Compatible with existing PHP frameworks and libraries, supports use in FPM/CLI environment
- Easy to use: 100% PHP code implementation, no more learning costs, provides a simple and easy-to-use API,
- Coroutine scheduling: Using `Fiber` and `Promise` mechanisms to achieve efficient coroutine scheduling.
- Asynchronous I/O: Provides asynchronous network and file I/O operations to avoid blocking.
- High concurrency processing: Supports high concurrency request processing, suitable for real-time applications and
  high load scenarios.
- Easy to integrate: Can be seamlessly integrated with traditional projects, providing simple installation and usage
  guides.

### Applicable scene

> Suitable for various scenarios requiring high concurrent processing, such as:

- Live chat application
- game server
- Real-time data analysis
- High concurrency API service
- High-performance components in microservice architecture

### Target readers

> This project document is suitable for the following readers:

- Developers interested in PHP coroutines and asynchronous programming
- Engineers who need to improve the performance of existing PHP applications
- Architects who want to introduce high concurrency processing capabilities into PHP projects

### start using
